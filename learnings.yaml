    It's possible to extract multiple subdirectories in a git repo into a new git repo using a combination of cloning and filter-branch.

    1. Clone the git repo and switch to the clone
    2. To extract the desired subdirectories (subdir1 and subdir2) run `git filter-branch --tree-filter "mkdir reorg && test -d subdir1 && mv subdir1 reorg/ || test -d subdir2 && mv subdir2 reorg/ || echo 'Nothing to do for requested directories'" HEAD`
    3. Move the desired subdirectories to the top level of the project with `git filter-branch -f --subdirectory-filter reorg -- --all`

    This will preserve the original author, date, commit message, and more.

    There is a MASSIVE performance difference between using DigestInputStream w/ one byte at a time vs. a read loop that uses a processing buffer (such as 8 KiB) when calculating a sha-256 on Android (and likely w/ other hash functions and on other platforms).
  
    The original code (all Kotlin, though maybe not ideomatic):
  
    ```kotlin
    val digest = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-256")
    val digestInputStream = DigestInputStream(inputStream, digest)
    while (digestInputStream.read() != -1);
    val digestBytes: ByteArray = digest.digest()
    ```
  
    The improved code:
    ```kotlin
    val digest = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-256")
    val buffer = ByteArray(8192) // 8 KiB buffer size
    var byteCount = it.read(buffer)
    while (byteCount > 0) {
        digest.update(buffer, 0, byteCount)
        byteCount = it.read(buffer)
    }
    val digestBytes = digest.digest()
    ```
  
    The change resulted in a performance difference of 15 seconds for a 7 MB file reduced down to 80 milliseconds. Both were using a BufferedInputStream and review of CPU usage in the Snapdragon Profiler showed that neither held a core at 100% during usage (not sure  why that wasn't the case in the second approach; maybe IO bound).

    When creating Android firmware signing keys you need to use sha1 as the message digest.
  
    The [Android developer site](https://source.android.com/devices/tech/ota/sign_builds#manually-generating-keys) talks about using `-3` for the public exponent, but doesn't mention the critical `-sha1` flag (or at least it was critical in the OTA + recovery we were working on).
